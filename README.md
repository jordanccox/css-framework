# CSS Framework

This is a project that I completed as a part of [Parsity's](parsity.io) coding bootcamp curriculum.

The purpose of this project was to build a custom CSS framework in order to better understand how CSS frameworks (such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)) work under the hood.
